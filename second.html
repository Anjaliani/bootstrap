									Game Of Thrones - Season 7 
								</h2>
								<p>
									<p>The latest Game of Thrones theory doing the rounds surrounds Bran's importance in the endgame of the HBO series.

			<p>Ever since his return to Winterfell as the all-seeing Three-Eyed Raven, the Stark child has been busy weirding his siblings out - but the character's future in the series may be about to take a veer into the even-more absurd with one theory suggesting he is the terrifying Night King.</p>

			<p>Reddit user turm0il26 believes an episode to come could see a time-travelling Bran - now the all-seeing Three-Eyed Raven - warg his way into the man who became the White Walker's leader in a bid to prevent the Children of the Forest from ever creating the army of the undead..</p>

			he theory goes that Bran's transition into the Night King could occur when the Children of the Forest pierce the man's heart with dragonglass leaving Bran stuck inside his body - a theory which seems more likely upon revisiting the season six scene showing the White Walkers' creation.</p>

											<h1>TOILET- <small>Ek prem Katha </small></h1>
											</dt>
											<dd>
												A woman leaves her husband on the first day of their marriage after discovering that he doesn't have a toilet in his home. He desperately sets out on a mission to win back his love by standing up to the age-old traditions and mindset of his village.
											</dd>
											<dt>
												Development
											</dt>
											<dd>
												The film is written by Siddharth Singh and Garima Wahal, the writers of the 2013 Hindi film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela, and shares some similarities with a true event in which 19-year old Priyanka Bharti fled her husband's home in 2012,[11] when there was no toilet
											</dd>
											
											<dt>
												Controversies
											</dt>
											<dd>
												A filmmaker named Praveen Vyas has sent a legal notice to the makers, claiming that ‘Toilet- Ek Prem Katha’ has plagiarised scenes and dialogues from his documentary ‘Manini', also based on the same subject.
											</dd>
											<dt>
												Critical reception
											</dt>
											<dd>
												Meena Iyer of Times of India gave the film 4/5 stars saying, "Director Shree Narayan Singh holds up a mirror to society, showing us how our superstitious villagers, lazy administration and corrupt politicians have actually converted India into the world’s largest shit-pond. Women especially, are treated more insensitively than cattle!". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated the film 2/5 and said, "It’s fitting that Akshay Kumar has greenlit and played the lead in this film, which is more a primer of How To Break Social Taboos and Make Toilets rather than a powerful social drama". Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave it 2.5/5 stars saying, "Ek Prem Katha endorses the Indian government’s Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan so seriously that after a point it starts to look like that Priyanka Bharti ad featuring Vidya Balan". Writing for The Hindu, Namrata Joshi said, "While some amount of potential (eventually lost) is visible in the first half, the second half of the film ends in a total mess". Anna MM of the First Post rated it 1.5/5 saying, "The tragedy of Toilet: Ek Prem Katha is that minus stalking and the chamchagiri, it could have been a good film".Saibal Chaterjee of NDTV giving the film 2/5 stars, said, "When what should at best have been a ten-minute public service film bloats into a two-and-a-half-hour, patience-testing, yawn-inducing Bollywood puff-job for a government scheme, it is bound to stink to high heaven. Toilet: Ek Prem Katha does". Rohit Bhatnagar of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5/5 and said, "Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar and Divyendu Sharma are sure to win you over with their quirky yet brilliant acts".
